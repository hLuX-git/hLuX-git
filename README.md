This project related to the boxing punch detection. 
This study explores the application of deep learning models, specifically YOLOv8 and Detectron2, for boxing punch detection. 
The motivation stems from the challenges of subjective decision-making and inconsistent scoring in boxing, where human refereesâ€™ evaluations can lead to errors.
